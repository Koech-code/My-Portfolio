        <p>My timer project was my second project to apply Javascript. It resembles a stopwatch. Has start, stop and reset<br>clickable buttons. On clicking the start button the seconds start to increment by one, but upon reaching 60 seconds, <br>it jumps over to minutes and seconds start over again. This also happens to the hours side.
